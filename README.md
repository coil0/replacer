Replacement tool for creative building (Mod for Minetest)

This tool is helpful for creative purposes (i.e. build a wall and "paint" windows into it).
It replaces nodes with a previously selected other type of node (i.e. places said windows
into a brick wall).

# Crafting

```
      | chest  |                       |        |
      |        | green energy crystal  |        |
      |        |                       | chest  |
```
Or just use `/giveme replacer:replacer`

# Usage

Sneak-right-click on a node of which type you want to replace other nodes with.
       Left-click (normal usage) on any nodes you want to replace with that type. Right-click to place a node of that type onto clicked node.

When in creative mode, the node will just be replaced. Your inventory will not be changed.

When *not* in creative mode, digging will be simulated and you will get what was there. In return, the replacement node
will be taken from your inventory.

# Modes

Special-right-click to cycle through the modes. Single-mode does not need any charge. The other modes do.

The second tool included in this mod is the inspector.

Crafting:
```
      | torch |      |     |
      | stick |      |     |
      |       |      |     |
```
Just wield it and click on any node or entity you want to know more about. A limited craft-guide is included.
